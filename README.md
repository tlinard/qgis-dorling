# Work In Progress  
QGIS plugin for creating Dorling cartograms.

This plugin is developed as part of a Master's thesis in geography at the University of Lausanne.  
It aims to provide an interactive and reproducible tool for generating Dorling circular cartograms directly within QGIS.

The algorithm relies on the original method proposed by Danny Dorling, using iterative force-based simulation to reposition circles based on statistical values and spatial relationships.

The plugin is still under active development.
